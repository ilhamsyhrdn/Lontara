🚀 Excited to share my latest full-stack project: Lontara - AI-Powered Email Classification System!

After months of development, I've built an intelligent email management platform that combines modern web technologies with machine learning.

🎯 Key Features:
• AI-powered email categorization using TensorFlow.js
• Real-time Gmail integration with OAuth2
• Interactive dashboard with analytics
• PDF attachment processing
• Role-based access control

💻 Tech Stack:
• Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, Material-UI, TailwindCSS
• Backend: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM, MongoDB
• ML: TensorFlow.js, Natural NLP
• Auth: JWT, Google OAuth2

The system automatically classifies emails into Urgent, Important, Normal, and Spam categories using a custom-trained neural network, helping users manage their inbox more efficiently.

## Option 2: Story-Driven

```
💡 Remember spending hours sorting through emails? I built a solution.

Introducing Lontara - an AI-powered email classification system that I've been working on for the past few months.

The Challenge:
Managing hundreds of emails daily is overwhelming. Important messages get lost, urgent matters are delayed, and spam clutters everything.

The Solution:
A full-stack application that uses machine learning to automatically categorize emails, providing:

✅ Real-time Gmail synchronization
✅ AI-powered smart categorization
✅ Beautiful, intuitive dashboard
✅ PDF processing capabilities
✅ Secure authentication system

The Tech Journey:
Built with Next.js 15 & React 19 for the frontend, powered by TensorFlow.js for ML classification, and MongoDB + Prisma for data management. The entire backend runs on serverless Next.js API routes.

What I Learned:
• Implementing neural networks in JavaScript
• Serverless architecture optimization  
• OAuth2 & JWT authentication
• Real-time data synchronization
• Natural language processing
